## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

Simply to:

1. get the solution to match the design
2. refactor the code to clean up the HTML and CSS

### Built with

- CSS flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When refactoring I opted to switch to using rem for padding, margin, width, height, and border-radius after reviewing other developers' code. Previously I had been using em or px and running into problems, particulary with padding and margin. Using rem units made it much easier to get my solution to match the design.

### Continued development

Over the next few challenges I plan to:

- add more best practices to my processes and code
- get better at recognizing a page (or component's) structure when looking at the design
- expand the use of css properties when appropriate
- continue to get my solution to match the design as close as possible
